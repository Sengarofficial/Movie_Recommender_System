## 

Generalized recommendations to every user nased on movie popularity to every user based on movie popularity and genre (content based). The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed along with particular type will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. The implementation of this model is extremely trivial. all we have to do is sort our movies based on ratings , popularity, and content type . As an added step , we can pass in a genre argument to get the top moview of a particular type. The main parameters that are considered for the recommendations are the genre, director, and top 3 casts. 




## Similarity Score : 

 How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes(or selects in our case) ? Here comes the similarity scores. 

 It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one i.e binary classification which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on as scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score i sthe measure of similarity between given texts details of two items.
